/**
 * RFC 8707 (Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0) resource-binding helpers.
 *
 * An MCP client connecting to a single vault (`<origin>/vault/<name>/mcp`)
 * discovers the hub as its authorization server via the RFC 9728 challenge
 * (`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=…`) → per-vault Protected
 * Resource Metadata. A spec-following client then sends the `resource`
 * parameter on `/oauth/authorize` naming that exact MCP endpoint.
 *
 * Before this module the hub dropped `resource` on the floor: the consent
 * screen advertised the ENTIRE scope catalog (every vault + hub:admin +
 * scribe:admin …) and the minted token's audience was derived purely from
 * the operator's manual vault-picker choice. Two failures fell out:
 *
 *   1. Scary consent — a friend connecting to ONE vault saw the whole hub's
 *      scope surface.
 *   2. Broad-scope rejection — an unnamed `vault:read` token (the shape a
 *      client gets when it never picks a specific vault) is REJECTED by a
 *      current-line vault (`findBroadVaultScopes`), because hub-issued tokens
 *      must carry resource-narrowed `vault:<name>:<verb>` scopes + a matching
 *      `aud=vault.<name>`.
 *
 * This module consumes `resource` end-to-end: when it resolves to a per-vault
 * MCP resource we derive `<name>`, narrow the consent scope list to that
 * vault's named scopes, lock the picker to `<name>`, and mint named scopes so
 * `inferAudience` stamps `aud=vault.<name>`.
 *
 * Source of truth for scope shape: `docs/contracts/oauth-scopes.md`.

 *     following client echoes back);
 *   - the PRM document:  `<origin>/vault/<name>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`

 * narrow consent for resources the hub itself fronts, so a `resource` naming
 * some third party's URL can't drive the vault-narrowing path.

 *     explicitly named a different vault is not silently re-pointed; the

 *     (see the header docstring): the verb-narrowing alone left the foreign
 *     scopes riding through, so a client that over-requests the whole-hub
 *     catalog (claude.ai reads it from the AS-metadata `scopes_supported`)
 *     still surfaced `scribe:admin` + `agent:send` on the consent screen.
 *     A client that genuinely wants a scribe token runs a separate flow
 *     naming the scribe resource.
 *
 * Idempotent: an already-narrowed list contains only `vault:` scopes, so a
 * second pass has nothing left to drop and `vault:<name>:<verb>` for THIS name
 * is returned as-is.
