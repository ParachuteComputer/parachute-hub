/**
 * `parachute migrate --to-supervised` (and `--teardown`) — the idempotent
 * detached→supervised CUTOVER, Phase 5a of the hub-as-supervisor unification
 * (design `parachute.computer/design/2026-06-01-hub-as-supervisor-unification.md`
 * §7.1–§7.5).
 *
 * This file is the MACHINERY; the BRIDGE stays intact. After 5a an un-migrated
 * box still works on the detached path (`defaultSpawner` / `ensureHubRunning`
 * remain — Phase 5b retires them). The cutover is opt-in (`--to-supervised`) or
 * auto-offered (§7.5, in `lifecycle.ts`). It NEVER runs implicitly.
 *
 * The cutover is the most dangerous operation in the CLI: it stops real running
 * services and installs a process-manager unit. So the ORDERING is load-bearing
 * and the whole path is FAIL-SAFE + RESUMABLE:
 *
 *   §7.1 ordering (stop-detached-FIRST-then-start-unit, to dodge the port-1939
 *   double-spawn race the canonical-ports 1939-pin would turn into a crash-loop):
 *     1. DETECT the current model (detached hub alive? each module alive?). If a
 *        hub unit already exists AND the hub is supervised → idempotent no-op.
 *     2. WRITE the unit file WITHOUT starting it (`installManagedUnit start:false`
 *        — daemon-reload but NOT enable --now / bootstrap). This is the §7.1
 *        race-avoider: the unit is on disk + resumable, but no second hub is
 *        started yet.
 *     3. STOP the detached processes — `stopHub` for the hub, a per-module
 *        pidfile stop for each module.
 *     4. §7.2 ORPHAN SWEEP — lsof per services.json port + the hub port; adopt +
 *        kill any process still bound to a declared port (mirrors stopHub's 1939
 *        orphan-adoption, per-module-port).
 *     5. VERIFY the hub port + each module port is free (bounded poll). If a port
 *        won't free, FAIL leaving the unit written-but-not-started so a retry is
 *        clean.
 *     6. START the unit (`installManagedUnit start:true` / enable --now). The hub
 *        comes up on a free 1939 and boots modules from services.json.
 *     7. VERIFY the hub answers /health and the expected modules are running.
 *     8. The cloudflared connector (if any) is left intact — it's its own unit.
 *
 * RESUMABILITY: a partial cutover (unit written, not started) is the canonical
 * recoverable state. Re-running `--to-supervised` from there:
 *   - DETECT sees a unit installed but the hub NOT supervised (no /health) → it
 *     does NOT no-op; it re-runs steps 2-7. Step 2 (write start:false) is
 *     idempotent (overwrites the same file), the stop steps are no-ops if the
 *     detached procs already died, and step 6 brings the unit up.
 *
 * FAIL-SAFE: every failure leaves a recoverable state. The only states we refuse
 * to leave the box in are (a) detached-stopped + unit-failed-to-start + no
 * recovery path. Step 6's start-failure leaves the unit written (re-runnable);
 * step 5's port-won't-free fails BEFORE stopping nothing-more and before
 * starting, with the unit written for a clean retry.
 *
 * EVERYTHING is behind injectable seams (the `CutoverDeps`) so the destructive
 * tests run in a sandbox `PARACHUTE_HOME` with NO real Bun.spawn / systemctl /
 * launchctl / lsof / process kills.
